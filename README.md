# AUTOMATED BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION UISNG AI


 This project aims to detect brain tumors using MRI scans of the brain. Initially, the model is trained on a dataset comprising both MRI scans with tumors and those without. The training process involves feeding the model with a set of brain images, enabling it to learn to differentiate between scans with and without tumors. Various libraries are utilized in the training process to enhance the model's ability to accurately identify and classify brain tumors in MRI scans.

To run this project, install the XAMPP control panel and SQLyog Enterprise software. Open XAMPP and start the MySQL server. Next, open SQLyog Enterprise and connect to the server.

Now, open the terminal and type the command "python manage.py runserver" to execute the server. Follow the generated link and register using your details. After logging in, select the desired model and upload the image to check for the presence of a tumor.
